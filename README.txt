From our original project proposal we had a couple minor changes, 
we did not utilize any of the GUI tools such as TailwindCSS and ChakraUI. 
Furthermore, instead of javascript, html, and css, we were able to 
implement our project using the Oracle database, html, and php integrated into our HTML.
