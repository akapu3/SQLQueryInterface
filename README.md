# SQL Query Interface
- I worked in a team of 3 for UBC's CPSC304 course
- As part of the project, we recreated the UBC Co-op Job Board. We began by creating a plan for the DataBase, which included all its entities and dependencies. We also created a relational model for the database as well as listed out all the implied functional dependencies. As part of the initial plan, we also created SQL DDLs for the SQL functions we implemented.
- The program includes functionality for:
  -   INSERT
  -   DELETE
  -   UPDATE
  -   Selection
  -   Projection
  -   Aggregation with Having
  -   Group By
  -   Nested Aggregation with Group By
  -   Aggregation with Group By
  -   Division
- We connected the front end using GET and POST requests. 


- The code can be found in index.php
